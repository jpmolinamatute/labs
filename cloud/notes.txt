change ImageId (!FindInMap)


HVMGP2 what the heck is this????
we may want to use CodeDeploy to deploy at least da

* First script will be a template where we can change what type of node this script will be ran
* I need to create a "wrapper" script that will create three** different script based on previous template. This script   MAY want to get airflow files and convert them to Base64 string and used all these to deploy the cloud formation file
* The first script will call a second script on EFS with a parameter (master, worker, scheduler)
* We may create one CloudFormation file per application PLUS a CloudFormation file for "infrastructure" or communication among applications
